# Implementation of Transformer Encoder from Scratch using TensorFlow

This project implements the Transformer Encoder architecture from scratch using TensorFlow. 

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you need to install the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- NumPy

## Usage

To run the code, execute the `untitled.ipynb` file. This will train the Transformer Encoder on a sample dataset and print the training loss and accuracy metrics.

## Results

The Transformer Encoder architecture was implemented from scratch using TensorFlow. The model was evaluated using a sample dataset.
